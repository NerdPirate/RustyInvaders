# RustyInvaders

## Overview
Having some fun learning Rust. I've implemented a Space Invaders clone in C years and years ago. Trying to do it again.

## Goals
Rather than doing things the "right" way and using crates, I'm trying to write as much of the code as possible myself.
Maybe I'll come back later and fix things up with crates that can do a better job than I can.
